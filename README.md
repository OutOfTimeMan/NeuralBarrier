This application, implemented on PyQT5, can recognize a car in an image from a webcam, also recognize the license plate and read it by checking it with the database. You can delete and add cars to the database that will be allowed to pass through. 
The application uses Yolov5, which I trained on hundreds of car images. EasyOCR is used for text recognition.
